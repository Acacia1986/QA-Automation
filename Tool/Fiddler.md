# FiddlerCap
Capturing web traffic logs

If you've reached this page, chances are good that you were asked to capture a Web Traffic log. Usually, this action is performed to track down a bug in your web browser or a website.

You can use FiddlerCap to capture your Web Traffic, and send that capture to a debugging buddy who can troubleshoot the bug.
