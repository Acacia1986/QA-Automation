# Zalenium
Allows anyone to have a disposable and flexible Selenium Grid infrastructure


What is Zalenium?

A Selenium Grid extension to scale up and down your local grid dynamically with docker containers. It uses docker-selenium to run your tests in Firefox and Chrome locally, and when you need a different browser, your tests get redirected to Sauce Labs and/or BrowserStack and/or TestingBot.
