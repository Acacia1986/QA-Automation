# Security Test Automation

The processes would be slightly varied from the original TDD process
* Perform a Static Security Scan on the code written
* Add a Test
* Run all tests and trigger Dynamic Security scan in the background
* See if the new one fails
* See if any security flaw identified on the newly developed code
* Write some code as per the security guidelines without affecting functional behavior
* Run tests and Refactor code
* Repeat
