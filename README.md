# How Functional Testing Works
Functional testing is typically conducted by providing an appropriate input to the function being tested (in line with the typical inputs expected in real-world use cases), and then verifying the result by comparing it to the expected result. This type of testing can answer questions about the capabilities of a software application, such as what actions users are able to perform.

It’s typically approached from one of two perspectives:

* **Requirements-focused testing**, which prioritizes requirements based on risk criteria in order to evaluate the most critical and important features and functions first.
* **Business-process-focused testing**, which relies on knowledge of end-user business requirements to evaluate an application’s performance in the context of typical use cases.

There are several specific functional testing techniques. The two primary techniques include white box testing and black box testing, although there are additional techniques including:

* Smoke testing.
* Unit testing.
* User acceptance testing.
* Integration testing.
* Interface testing.
* System testing.
* Localization testing.
* Regression testing.
* Globalization testing.


# Non-functional Testing
* Security testing.
* Usability testing.
* Operational readiness testing.
* Endurance testing.
* Interoperability testing.
* Maintainability testing.
* Ergonomics testing.
* Availability testing.
* Recoverability testing.
* And others!
