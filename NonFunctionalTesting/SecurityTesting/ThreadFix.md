Managing Your Application Security Program with the ThreadFix Ecosystem!
https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/arsenal/us-14-Cornell-ThreadFix-Slides.pdf

ThreadFix is a software vulnerability aggregation and management system that helps organizations aggregate vulnerability data, generate virtual patches, and interact with software defect tracking systems.

“We built ThreadFix so that application security teams can create a consolidated view of their applications and identified vulnerabilities, make risk-based decisions on which vulnerabilities to address and how, and then communicate those vulnerabilities to developers in the tools they’re already using,” Dan Cornell, ThreadFix Project Creator and Denim Group CTO, told Help Net Security.

“What we want to do is provide a vulnerability resolution platform that takes care of the rote data management tasks so that security analysts can focus their time on higher-value activities. Also having all this data in a single location lets teams run reports and track metrics, and this allows them to take a much more quantitative approach to running and evolving their security programs.”

ThreadFix integrates with 30+ tools, services and technologies, so keeping all of those integrations up to date can be challenging. “Every organization runs their testing program a little bit differently, so we’ve had to be very flexible in how we allow data to be loaded into the system – manually, via our REST API, or via a series of plugins to things like Jenkins, etc.,” says Cornell.

For any enterprise that develops several applications simultaneously, making security a focus during the development process can be a struggle. Scanning tools can analyze applications for vulnerabilities, but ranking the relative importance of each vulnerability and its fix status can be challenging: Exporting data from multiple scanners involving numerous applications in development can create confusion.

With ThreadFix installed on one machine, Barker uses a client machine's browser to visit via proxy the BodgeIt store, a vulnerable Web application designed for penetration testing. Once the proxy captures the vulnerabilities from the BodgeIt store, Barker shows how simple it is to export the scanner data to ThreadFix. The tool is capable of aggregating export data from a variety of open source and commercial security scanners, including OWASP's Zed Attack Proxy and Nessus, which means most enterprises will have no problem using their scanner of choice. ThreadFix even accepts input from manual scans.
