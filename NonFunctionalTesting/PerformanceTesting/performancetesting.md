# Reasons to Execute Performance Testing?
Performance testing establishes the accuracy of throughput, scalability, reliability and responsiveness of a system under a specific workload.
Performance testing is usually executed in order to achieve the following:
* **evaluating** production readiness
* **assessing** against performance parameters
* **Comparison** of performance uniqueness of numerous systems or configurations of systems
* Locating the **basis** of performance related issues
* **Tuning** the Support methods
* Locating **throughput stages**
* Establishing **conformity** with performance objectives and requisites 
* amassing other performance-associates statistics to assist stakeholders formulating informed decisions
* To Guarantee the **hardware configuration** suitability  for the performance of application
