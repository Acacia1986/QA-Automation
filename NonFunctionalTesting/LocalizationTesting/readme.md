Localization Testing Services
 
Are you planning to release your application to support multiple languages and locales? We at Test Triangle provide solutions to test your application in various different languages, and also we can test your application under various user locale preferences.

Our test engineers have worked in various projects which involved translation verification testing and locale testing, and so are adept at testing for issues such as time and date formats in different locales, currency denominations as well as visual impacts of localized content in space-constrained UIs.
